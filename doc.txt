Github is a web-based code hosting platform used for version control. 
Git simplifies the process of collaborating with other people and makes it easy to collaborate on projects. 
Team members can work on files and easily merge their changes in with the master branch of the project.
The primary benefit of GitHub is its version control system, 
which allows for seamless collaboration without compromising the integrity of the original project. 
The projects on GitHub are examples of open-source software.
